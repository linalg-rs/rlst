# Rust Linear Solver Toolbox

The Rust Linear Solver toolbox is an in-development project for
dense and sparse linear algebra routines in Rust.

## Notes

This library is the result of the merger of two experimental linear algebra projects

- Householder (github.com/UCL-ARC/householder)
- sandbox (github.com/linalg-rs/sandbox)

Both projects are MIT + Apache-2.0 dual licensed. The Rust Linear Solver
toolbox is the successor of both projects.
