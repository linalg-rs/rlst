//! # Basic concepts
//!
//! Let us start by defining a random `(3, 5, 2)` array.
//! ```
//! use rlst::prelude::*;
//! use rand::Rng;
//! let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
//! let mut arr1 = rlst_dynamic_array3!(f64, [3, 5, 2]);
//! arr1.fill_from_equally_distributed(&mut rng);
//! ```
//! [rlst_dynamic_array3](crate::rlst_dynamic_array3) is a macro
//! that initialises a new array on the heap filled with zeros.
//! The following types are supported: [f32], [f64], [c32](crate::dense::types::c32), [c64](crate::dense::types::c64).
//!
//! Let us define a second `(3, 5, 2)` array and do some operations.
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! # let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
//! # let mut arr1 = rlst_dynamic_array3!(f64, [3, 5, 2]);
//! # arr1.fill_from_equally_distributed(&mut rng);
//! let mut arr2 = rlst_dynamic_array3!(f64, [3, 5, 2]);
//! arr2.fill_from_equally_distributed(&mut rng);
//!
//! let res = 3.0 * arr1 + 5.0 * arr2;
//! ```
//! The variable `res` is of a different type from `arr1` and `arr2`. It is an addition type that
//! represents the addition of two arrays. RLST internally uses an expression template arithmetic.
//! Array operations are only executed when requested by the user. We can evaluate the expression
//! into a new array using the following command.
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! # let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
//! # let mut arr1 = rlst_dynamic_array3!(f64, [3, 5, 2]);
//! # arr1.fill_from_equally_distributed(&mut rng);
//! # let mut arr2 = rlst_dynamic_array3!(f64, [3, 5, 2]);
//! # arr2.fill_from_equally_distributed(&mut rng);
//! # let res = 3.0 * arr1 + 5.0 * arr2;
//! let mut output = rlst_dynamic_array3!(f64, [3, 5, 2]);
//! output.fill_from(res);
//! ```
//! We can write the whole operation shorter as follows.
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! # let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
//! # let mut arr1 = rlst_dynamic_array3!(f64, [3, 5, 2]);
//! # arr1.fill_from_equally_distributed(&mut rng);
//! # let mut arr2 = rlst_dynamic_array3!(f64, [3, 5, 2]);
//! # arr2.fill_from_equally_distributed(&mut rng);
//! let output = empty_array().fill_from_resize(3.0 * arr1 + 5.0 * arr2);
//! ```
//! There is an important principle behind this. All operations in RLST that allocate new memory on the heap are explicit.
//! Simply writing `let res = 3.0 * arr1 + 5.0 * arr2` does not allocate new memory on the heap. If we want to evaluate
//! this operation into a new array we have to create this ourself. To make this easier the function `empty_arry` exists.
//! It creates a new array of zero size. Many RLST routines have variants with the additional marker `_resize`. These can
//! resize an existing array when required. So the command `let output = empty_array().fill_from_resize(3.0 * arr1 + 5.0 * arr2);`
//! creates a new empty array and then resizes it to fill with the result of the array operation.
//!
//! The operation `3.0 * arr1 + 5.0 * arr2` takes ownership of the variables `arr1` and `arr2`. Most operations in RLST by default
//! take ownership. If this is not desired one can instead use a `view` object.
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! # let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
//! # let mut arr1 = rlst_dynamic_array3!(f64, [3, 5, 2]);
//! # arr1.fill_from_equally_distributed(&mut rng);
//! # let mut arr2 = rlst_dynamic_array3!(f64, [3, 5, 2]);
//! # arr2.fill_from_equally_distributed(&mut rng);
//! let output = empty_array().fill_from_resize(3.0 * arr1.view() + 5.0 * arr2.view());
//! ```
//! The method `arr1.view()` creates a `view` object that stores a reference to `arr1`. Ownership is now taken of the `view` object and
//! not of `arr1`. Ownership rules of Rust naturally extend to `view` objects since they are container that store Rust references. A mutable
//! view is created through `arr1.view_mut()`.
//!
//! # Element access
//!
//! To get the value of an element of an array at an arbitrary position the method [get_value](crate::RandomAccessByValue::get_value)
//! is provided. [get_value](crate::RandomAccessByValue::get_value) does not return a reference but an actual value. It can therefore always be used
//! even when the array represents a complicated expression. If it is possible to have a reference to an element (i.e. the array is associated
//! with elements in memory) then direct index notation is also possible. Both are shown below.
//!
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! let mut arr = rlst_dynamic_array3!(f64, [3, 4, 2]);
//! arr.fill_from_seed_equally_distributed(0);
//! assert_eq!(arr.get_value([2, 3, 1]).unwrap(), arr[[2, 3, 1]]);
//! ```
//! To get a reference to an element use the method [get](crate::RandomAccessByRef::get). A mutable variant is available as [get_mut](crate::RandomAccessMut::get_mut).
//! These methods by default perform bounds checking. Unsafe variants without bounds checking are available in the traits [UnsafeRandomAccessByRef](crate::UnsafeRandomAccessByRef),
//! [UnsafeRandomAccessByValue](crate::UnsafeRandomAccessByValue), and [UnsafeRandomAccessMut](crate::UnsafeRandomAccessMut).
//!
//! # Array allocations
//!
//! RLST arrays can be allocated either on the heap or on the stack. Heap based allocations can be done dynamically at runtime.
//! Stack based allocations happens at compile time and the exact size of the array must be known. Stack based arrays are of advantage
//! for small fixed sizes when the overhead of allocating memory at runtime can impact performance.
//!
//! ## Heap based array allocations
//!
//! A heap based allocation is done by the macro `rlst_dynamic_arrayX`, where `X` is between 1 and 5 and denotes the number of axes of the
//! array. Higher axes numbers are possible. But we do not provide convenience macros for these cases. To allocate an array with two axes
//! that can hold double precision numbers we use
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! let mut arr = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [5, 4]);
//! ```
//! This is a short form for the following longer initialisation.
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! let mut arr = DynamicArray::<f64, 2>::from_shape([5, 4]);
//! ````    
//!
//! ## Stack based array allocations.
//!
//! Allocating an array on the stack works quite similarly.
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! let mut arr = rlst_static_array!(f64, 5, 4);
//! ```
//! Internally, a heap based RLST array uses a Rust [Vec] while a Stack based array uses a Rust [array] type to store data.
//! Both, heap based and stack based arrays implement the same traits to provide the same functionality. However, stack based
//! arrays cannot be resized.
//!
//! ## Arrays from memory slices
//!
//! One can create an array from a given memory slice. The following example shows how to do this.
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! let myvec = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0];
//! let arr = rlst_array_from_slice2!(myvec.as_slice(), [2, 3]);
//! ```
//! To initialise the array from the slice with a non-standard slice one can provide a slice array explicitly. The following creates
//! an array from the slice using a row-major memory ordering.
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! let myvec = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0];
//! let stride = [3, 1];
//! let arr = rlst_array_from_slice2!(myvec.as_slice(), [2, 3], stride);
//! ```
//!
//! # Strides
//!
//! The stride of an array denotes how elements are mapped from n-dimensions to 1-dimensional memory locations. Let the stride
//! be [s1, s2, s3, ..] then an index (a1, a2, a3, ...) is mapped to a 1-dimensional index through `ind = a1 * s1 + a2 * s2 + a3 * s3 + ...`.
//! The default stride in RLST is column-major. This means that the first dimension is consecutive in memory. For heap based arrays
//! a non-default stride can be provided
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! let stride = [4, 1];
//! let mut arr = DynamicArray::<f64, 2>::from_shape_with_stride([5, 4], stride);
//! ```
//! The above array uses a row-major stride, meaning consecutive elements in a row are consecutive in memory.
//! RLST supports arbitrary strides. However, operations that rely on extenal BLAS or Lapack interfaces require a column-major ordering.
//!
//! # Views and mutable views
//!
//! Most operations in RLST take ownership of their arguments. If we want to avoid this we can create `view` objects. A borrowed view is
//! created as follows.
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! let mut arr = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [5, 4]);
//! let view = arr.view();
//! ```
//! To create a mutable view use instead `arr.view_mut()`. Views are just contianer that hold references to the original array. They implement
//! all traits that also arrays implement and can be used interchangeably. Hence, of a RLST function takes ownership of an array one can provide
//! instead a `view` object and the function takes ownership of the view and not of the original array.
//!
//! # Array slicing
//!
//! RLST allows the slicing of arrays across a given dimension. Given the following array.
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! let arr = rlst_dynamic_array3!(f64, [5, 3, 2]);
//! ```
//! we can slice at the first index of the second dimension as follows.
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! # let arr = rlst_dynamic_array3!(f64, [5, 3, 2]);
//! let slice = arr.view().slice(1, 0);
//! ```
//! This creates a two dimensional array of dimension `(5, 2)`. Any index `[a, b]` into this array
//! is mapped to an index `[a, 0, b]` of the original array. A slice is mutable if the original array or view was mutable.
//! A frequent example is access to a single column or row in a given matrix.
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! let arr = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [4, 6]);
//! // This gives the third column
//! let slice = arr.view().slice(1, 2);
//! // This gives the fourth row
//! let slice = arr.view().slice(0, 3);
//! ```
//!
//! # Array iterators
//!
//! The default iterator returns elements of an array in column-major order independent of the underlying stride.
//! The following example demonstrates the default iterator.
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! let mut arr = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [2, 3]);
//! for elem in arr.iter_mut() {
//!     *elem = 2.0;
//! }     
//! ```
//! This fills all elements of an array with the value `2.0`. It is often useful to get the multi index of an element together
//! with the element itself. This can be achieved as follows.
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! # let mut arr = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [2, 3]);
//! # arr.fill_from_seed_equally_distributed(0);
//! let shape = arr.shape();
//! for (multi_index, elem) in arr.iter().enumerate().multi_index(shape) {
//!     assert_eq!(elem, arr[multi_index]);
//! }
//! ```
//! The following iterators are provided by default.
//! - [iter](crate::DefaultIterator): Default column-major iterator.
//! - [iter_mut](crate::DefaultIteratorMut::iter_mut): Default mutable column-major iterator.
//! - [row_iter](crate::Array::row_iter): Iterator over rows of a two-dimensional array.
//! - [row_iter_mut](crate::Array::row_iter_mut): Mutable iterator over rows of a two-dimensional array.
//! - [col_iter](crate::Array::col_iter): Iterator over columns of a two-dimensional array.
//! - [col_iter_mut](crate::Array::col_iter_mut): Mutable iterator over columns of a two-dimensional array.
//!
//!
//! ## Operations on arrays
//! ### Static lazy evaluation
//! RLST uses a system of static lazy evaluation for array operations. Consider the following example.
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! # let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
//! let mut arr = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [2, 3]);
//! arr.fill_from_equally_distributed(&mut rng);
//! let res = 5.0 * arr.view();
//! ```
//! The array `res` is not connected with a memory region. It internally takes ownership of a view into `arr` and every random access to that
//! view is multipltakes ownership of a view into `arr` and every random access to that
//! view is multiplied by `5.0`. The `res` array implements also all traits that other arrays implement and can be used like any other array.
//! The only exception is raw access to its memory. Since it does not have its own memory it does not implement the [RawAccess](crate::RawAccess) trait.
//! To evaluate the operation `5.0 * arr.view()` one creates a new array and fills this array with values as follows.
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! # let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
//! let mut arr = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [2, 3]);
//! let mut res = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [2, 3]);
//! arr.fill_from_equally_distributed(&mut rng);
//! res.fill_from(5.0 * arr.view());
//! ```
//! The [fill_from](crate::dense::array::Array::fill_from) method iterates through `5.0 * arr.view()` and fills the array `res` with the returned values.
//! The advantage of this approach is that more complex operations such as `res.fill_from(5.0 * arr1.view() + 3.0 * arr2.view())` only require a single
//! loop through the data and create no temporary objects. RLST provides [various different methods](#evaluating-arrays-into-other-arrays) to evaluate an
//! array into another array.
//!
//! ## Multiplication with a scalar
//!
//! The following options are available to multiply an array with a scalar.
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! # let mut arr = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [2, 3]);
//! arr.scale_inplace(5.0);
//! let res1 = 5.0 * arr.view();
//! let res2 = arr.view().scalar_mul(5.0);
//! ```
//! The method [scale_in_place](crate::Array::scale_inplace) immediately scales in place all elements of the array by the given scalar. The commands
//! `5.0 * arr` and `arr.view().scalar_mul(5.0)` are identical. They both return a new lazy evaluation object without performing the scalar multiplication.
//!
//! ## Negation of an array
//!
//! To negate the elements of an array use one of
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! # let mut arr = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [2, 3]);
//! let res1 = arr.view().neg();
//! let res2 = -1.0 * arr.view();
//! ```
//! Both operations are identical and return a lazy evaluation object.
//!
//! ## Addition and subtraction of arrays
//!
//! To add/subtract arrays use one of
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! # let arr1 = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [2, 3]);
//! # let arr2 = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [2, 3]);
//! let res1 = arr1.view() + arr2.view();
//! let res2 = arr1.view().add(arr2.view());
//! let res3 = arr1.view() - arr2.view();
//! let res4 = arr1.view().sub(arr2.view());
//! ```
//! The add, respectively subtraction operations, are implemented in the same way and return a lazy evaluation object that
//! represents addition/subtraction of the arrays.
//!
//! ## Componentwise multiplication and division
//!
//! Componentwise multiplication and division of two arrays is performed as follows.
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! # let arr1 = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [2, 3]);
//! # let arr2 = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [2, 3]);
//! let res1 = arr1.view() * arr2.view();
//! let res2 = arr1.view() / arr2.view();
//! ```
//! Both operations use lazy evaluation.
//!
//! ## Transposition of arrays
//!
//! Lazy transposition of an array is performed as follows.
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! # let arr = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [2, 3]);
//! let res = arr.view().transpose();
//! ```
//! For general n-dimensional arrays transposition reverses the order of axes. More general axes permutations are available
//! through the [permute_axes](crate::Array::permute_axes) method. Note that this method only performs transposition. To take the
//! complex conjugate transpose use
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! # let arr = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [2, 3]);
//! let res = arr.view().conj().transpose();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Conversion to complex type
//!
//! Sometimes it is useful to convert the type of an array to the corresponding complex type. This is done lazily as follows.
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! # let arr = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [2, 3]);
//! let res = arr.view().to_complex();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Conjugation of an array
//!
//! Lazy complex conjugation of an array is done as below.
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! # let arr = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [2, 3]);
//! let res = arr.view().conj();
//! ```
//!
//! # Evaluating arrays into other arrays
//!
//! To simply fill an array with the values of an other array the method [fill_from](crate::dense::array::Array::fill_from) is provided. See the following example.
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! let arr1 = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [2, 3]);
//! let mut arr2 = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [2, 3]);
//! arr2.fill_from(arr1.view());
//! ```
//! The [fill_from](crate::dense::array::Array::fill_from) method takes ownership of its arguments. If this is not desired a `view` should passed into the method as
//! in the example above. The [fill_from](crate::dense::array::Array::fill_from) method assumes that both arrays have the same shape and type. However, they need not
//! have the same stride. A variant that allows resizing of the target array is given by [fill_from_resize](crate::dense::array::Array::fill_from_resize). With this method
//! a simple heap allocated copy of an array can be created through
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! # let arr1 = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [2, 3]);
//! let arr2 = empty_array().fill_from_resize(arr1.view());
//! ```
//! Instead of `fill_from` the method [sum_into](crate::dense::array::Array::sum_into) can be used to sum the values of one array into another array. This method has no `resize` variant.
//!
//! Both `fill_from` and `sum_into` may not be automatically SIMD vectorized by the compiler. The compiler has no assumptions on how the elements of the two arrays are accessed in memory.
//! To solve this problem a chunked evaluation is possible. Consider the following example.
//! ```
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! let arr1 = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [2, 3]);
//! let mut arr2 = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [2, 3]);
//! arr2.fill_from_chunked::<_, 16>(5.0 * arr1.view());
//! ```
//! The chunked evaluation passes through `arr1.view()` in chunks of 16, copying 16 elements at a time into a buffer and then multiplying each element in the buffer by `5.0`. This allows effective
//! SIMD evaluation but comes at a price of an additional copy operation. The buffer is not heap allocated but lives on the stack and its size is determined as const generic parameter at compile time.
//! Good sizes are multiples of the SIMD vector length of a CPU. The number of elements in an array does not need to be an exact multiple of the chunk size. This case is handled correctly in RLST.
//! In summary, the following methods provide evaluation of an array into another array.
//! - [fill_from](crate::dense::array::Array::fill_from)
//! - [fill_from_chunked](crate::dense::array::Array::fill_from_chunked)
//! - [fill_from_resize](crate::dense::array::Array::fill_from_resize)
//! - [fill_from_chunked_resize](crate::dense::array::Array::fill_from_chunked_resize)
//! - [sum_into](crate::dense::array::Array::sum_into)
//! - [sum_into_chunked](crate::dense::array::Array::sum_into_chunked)
//!
//! # Matrix multiplication
//!
//! RLST uses its BLAS interface to perform matrix multiplication.
//! To use matrix products make sure to have a BLAS/Lapack provider as explained [here](crate::doc::initialise_rlst). Furthermore,
//! because of BLAS only column-major order is supported for matrix products. To convert a matrix to column-major order simply initialise
//! a new matrix with column-major order (default stride) and evaluate the existing matrix into the new matrix.
//!
//! The following operation is the most simple way of multiplying two matrices into a new matrix.
//!
//! ```
//! # extern crate blas_src;
//! # extern crate lapack_src;
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! # let arr1 = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [4, 5]);
//! # let arr2 = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [5, 3]);
//! let res = empty_array().simple_mult_into_resize(arr1.view(), arr2.view());
//! ```
//! This multiplies the matrices `arr1` and `arr2` into a new matrix `res`. The method [simple_mult_into_resize](crate::dense::traits::MultIntoResize::simple_mult_into_resize)
//! resizes the result array if necessary. To multiply multiple arrays one can chain the `simple_mult_into_resize` method.
//!
//! ```
//! # extern crate blas_src;
//! # extern crate lapack_src;
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! # let arr1 = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [2, 2]);
//! # let arr2 = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [2, 2]);
//! # let arr3 = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [2, 2]);
//! let res = empty_array().simple_mult_into_resize(
//!             empty_array().simple_mult_into_resize(arr1.view(), arr2.view()),
//!             arr3.view()
//!           );
//! ```
//! The rationale behind this interface is that the user may want to store results of the multiplication in stack allocated arrays.
//! Hence, the matrix multiplication cannot implicitly allocate a new matrix on the heap. For multiplication into matrices
//! that cannot be resied (e.g. stack allocate matrices) the method [simple_mult_into](crate::dense::traits::MultInto::simple_mult_into)
//! should be used. This method does not rely on being able to resize an array. However, it panics if the result matrix does not have
//! correct dimensions.
//!
//! A more complete BLAS like interface is provided by the method [mult_into](crate::dense::traits::MultInto::mult_into), which performs
//! `C = alpha * op(A) * op(B) + beta * C`, for matrices `A`, `B`, and `C`, where `op` is the identity, transpose, or conjugate transpose.
//!
//! # LU Decomposition and solving linear systems of equations
//!
//! Through its Lapack interface RLST can solve dense linear systems of equations. A linear system of equations is solved as follows.
//! ```
//! # extern crate blas_src;
//! # extern crate lapack_src;
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! let mut rand = rand::thread_rng();
//! let mut arr = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [4, 4]);
//! let mut rhs = rlst_dynamic_array1!(f64, [4]);
//! arr.fill_from_equally_distributed(&mut rand);
//! let lu = LuDecomposition::<f64, _ >::new(arr).expect("LU Decomposition failed.");
//! lu.solve_vec(TransMode::NoTrans, rhs.view_mut()).expect("LU solve failed.");
//! ```
//! The variable `rhs` is overwritten with the solution to the linear system of equations. For solving with multiple right-hand sides use the
//! [solve_mat](crate::dense::linalg::lu::MatrixLuDecomposition::solve_mat). Note that the structure [LuDecomposition](crate::dense::linalg::lu::LuDecomposition)
//! takes ownership of `arr` and overwrites the content of its memory with the LU Decomposition. To obtain the individual factors of the LU decomposition see
//! the documentation of [MatrixLuDecomposition](crate::dense::linalg::lu::MatrixLuDecomposition).
//!
//! If only a single solve is required and the LU factors need not be stored a shorter version is available as
//! ```
//! # extern crate blas_src;
//! # extern crate lapack_src;
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! let mut rand = rand::thread_rng();
//! let mut arr = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [4, 4]);
//! let mut rhs = rlst_dynamic_array1!(f64, [4]);
//! arr.fill_from_equally_distributed(&mut rand);
//! let sol = arr.into_solve_vec(TransMode::NoTrans, rhs).expect("LU solve failed.");
//! ```
//! The method [into_solve_vec](crate::dense::array::Array::into_solve_vec) takes ownership of `rhs` and the array `arr`. It returns ownership of `rhs` and
//! overwrites it with the solution. For convenience `rhs` is then returned again as `sol`. The array `arr` is also overwritten with the LU factors.
//! A corresponding routine [into_solve_mat](crate::dense::array::Array::into_solve_mat) is available.
//!
//! # Pivoted QR Decomposition
//!
//! The pivted QR decomposition of a matrix `A` is given as `AP=QR`, where `P` is a permutation matrix, `R` is upper triangular, and
//! `Q` has orthogonal columns. For details see the documentation of [MatrixQrDecomposition](crate::dense::linalg::qr::MatrixQrDecomposition).
//!
//! The pivoted QR decomposition of a matrix can be computed as follows.
//! ```
//! # extern crate blas_src;
//! # extern crate lapack_src;
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! let mut rand = rand::thread_rng();
//! let mut arr = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [8, 5]);
//! let mut r_mat = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [5, 5]);
//! let mut p_mat = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [5, 5]);
//! let mut q_mat = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [8, 5]);
// ! arr.fill_from_equally_distributed(&mut rand);
//! let qr = QrDecomposition::<f64, _>::new(arr).expect("QR Decomposition failed");
//! qr.get_r(r_mat.view_mut());
//! qr.get_q_alloc(q_mat.view_mut());
//! qr.get_p(p_mat.view_mut());
//! ````
//! The content of `arr` is overwritten with the QR decomposition. The method [get_q_alloc](crate::dense::linalg::qr::MatrixQrDecomposition::get_q_alloc)
//! needs to allocate additional temporary memory on the heap. This is why it is annoted with `_alloc`.
//!
//! # Singular value decomposition
//!
//! To compute the singular values of a two-dimensional array `arr` use
//! ```
//! # extern crate blas_src;
//! # extern crate lapack_src;
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! let mut rand = rand::thread_rng();
//! let mut arr = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [8, 5]);
//! let mut singvals = rlst_dynamic_array1!(f64, [5]);
//! arr.into_singular_values_alloc(singvals.data_mut()).unwrap();
//! ```
//! This computes the singular values of `arr` into `singvals`. The method [into_singular_values_alloc](crate::MatrixSvd::into_singular_values_alloc)
//! needs to allocate temporary memory on the heap. This is why it has the ending `_alloc`. To compute the whole
//! singular value decomposition use the method [into_svd_alloc](crate::MatrixSvd::into_svd_alloc).
//! ```
//! # extern crate blas_src;
//! # extern crate lapack_src;
//! # use rlst::prelude::*;
//! let mut rand = rand::thread_rng();
//! let mut arr = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [8, 5]);
//! let mut u = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [8, 5]);
//! let mut vt = rlst_dynamic_array2!(f64, [5, 5]);
//! let mut sigma = rlst_dynamic_array1!(f64, [5]);
//! arr.into_svd_alloc(u.view_mut(), vt.view_mut(), sigma.data_mut(), SvdMode::Reduced).unwrap();
//! ```
//! To compute the full SVD use the parameter [SvdMode::Full](crate::SvdMode::Full).
//!
