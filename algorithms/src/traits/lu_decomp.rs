/// Defines the LU Decomposition of a matrix.
///
/// The LU Decomposition for a general `(m, n)` matrix has the form
/// `PA = LU` with `P` a `(m, m)` permutation matrix, `L`, a `(m, k)` lower triangular (or trapezoidal)
/// matrix with ones on the diagonal, and `U` a `(k, n)` upper triangular (or trapezoidal) matrix.
/// Here, `k=min(m, n)`. The [`LUDecomp::get_l`] and [`LUDecomp::get_u`] routines can be used to obtain the `L` and `U` matrices.
/// The `P` matrix is implicitly defined through a permutation vector `perm` returned by [`LUDecomp::get_perm`].
/// It is defined in such a way that the ith row of `LU` is identical to row `perm[i]` of the original
/// matrix `A`. To solve a linear system `Ax=b` the routine [`LUDecomp::solve`] is provided.
